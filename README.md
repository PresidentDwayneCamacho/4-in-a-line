# An artificial intelligence for the 4-in-a-row game


The game vaguely represents tic-tac-toe, though victory is achieved by getting 4 pieces in a row on an 8x8 game board


Program can be compiled with the command:

 > g++ -std=c++11 *.h *.cpp -o game.exe

 and to run:

 > ./game


This contains the game with a few testing helper functions.
